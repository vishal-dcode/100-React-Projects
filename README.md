# 100 React Projects

Welcome to my repository containing ongoing React projects! This repository is continuously updated as I create new projects. The projects are divided into three levels: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced. Various frameworks are used in these each projects, including Tailwind CSS, React Router, React Redux, Redux Toolkit, TypeScript, and more.

Each project in this repository is designed to help developers learn and practice different aspects of React development. Whether you're a beginner looking to get started with React or an experienced developer wanting to explore advanced topics, you'll find something here to challenge and inspire you.

## How to Run the Projects

To run any of the projects, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies for the frontend using npm install or yarn install.
4. Some projects may require a backend server running at localhost:8080. If the project includes a backend, navigate to the backend directory (usually named server or backend) and install backend dependencies using npm install or yarn install. Then, start the backend server using npm start or yarn start.
5. Once the backend server is running, return to the project directory and start the frontend using npm start or yarn start.
6. View the project in your web browser at the specified localhost address.

Be sure to follow any additional instructions provided in the project's README file for specific setup requirements for both the frontend and backend. Enjoy exploring and experimenting with the projects!
